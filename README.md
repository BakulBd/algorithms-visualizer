# 🧑‍💻 **Algorithms Visualizer**

Welcome to **Algorithms Visualizer**!  
This project is a **React-based** web application that provides an interactive and visual representation of various algorithms, including **Sorting Algorithms** and **Huffman Encoding**.  
It’s designed to help you understand the step-by-step process of these algorithms through dynamic animations.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** 🌀
- **Quick Sort** ⚡
- **Merge Sort** 🔀
- **Selection Sort** 🔢

Experience the process of sorting data in real-time with intuitive visualizations.

### 2. Huffman Encoding
- Visualizes the construction of the **Huffman Tree** for character encoding 📜
- Interactive step-by-step breakdown to understand how data compression works

### 3. Interactive Animations
- Real-time animations show the evolution of algorithms and tree construction 🔄
- Adjust animation speed to control how fast or slow the visualizations run 🕹️

### 4. Educational Tool
- Understand the logic, efficiency, and complexity of different algorithms 📚

### 5. Responsive Design
- The application is **mobile-friendly** and responsive across all devices 📱💻
